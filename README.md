# Machine Readable Word Lists

Unfortunately, a lot of the word lists that are available on line are not in
structured machine readable format (eg, some are pdfs, others are in html).

This is a collection of those lists converted into `.yml` and `.json`, so they
can be readily consumed and manipulated by computers.

## Word Lists

### Academic

* University Word List (UWL)

An 836-item academic vocabulary list that compiles academic English common to a variety of disciplines but excluded from the GSL. Especially useful for academic reading and provides on average some 8.5% coverage of academic texts (Nation & Waring, 1997). Divided into 11 sublists based on frequency.

* Academic Keyword List (AKL)

930 potentially academic words which are listed into nouns, verbs, adjectivies, adverbs and others. The AKL differs from Coxhead’s Academic Word List as it includes high frequency words (e.g. aim, argue, because, compare, explain, namely, result) shown to play an essential structuring role in academic prose.
