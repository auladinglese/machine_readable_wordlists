# Machine Readable Word Lists

Unfortunately, a lot of the word lists that are available on line are not in
structured machine readable format (eg, some are pdfs).

This is a collection of those lists converted into `.yml` and `.json`, so they
can be readily consumed and manipulated by computers.

## Word Lists

### Academic

* University Word List (UWL)

An 836-item academic vocabulary list that compiles academic English common to a variety of disciplines but excluded from the GSL. Especially useful for academic reading and provides on average some 8.5% coverage of academic texts (Nation & Waring, 1997). Divided into 11 sublists based on frequency.
